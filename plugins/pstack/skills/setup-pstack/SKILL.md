# Setup pstack

Write `~/.claude/pstack-models.mdc`, a user-level config file that pstack skills read for model-per-role overrides.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Enumerate model identifiers you can assign to subagents (Agent tool `model` parameter, `/model`, or your environment's model list). If you cannot detect any, ask the user to paste the models they have access to. Never write a model id you have not confirmed is available. The aliases `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not detected slugs.

### 2. Load current state

The default role-to-model mapping is the shape shown in step 5 below. If `~/.claude/pstack-models.mdc` already exists, read it and treat its `# budget` line and its role values as the current choices. Otherwise start from those defaults. A line whose role is not in step 5, such as `how critics`, is from a retired role. Drop it.

### 3. Budget, map, and confirm

**(a) Ask for a budget.** Prefer structured multiple-choice over free text when available. Offer these four options with these exact labels, and name the current budget when the file records one. With no file, say that `large` matches the skill defaults.

- `unlimited — max reasoning`
- `large — xhigh reasoning`
- `medium — high reasoning`
- `small — medium reasoning`

**(b) Apply it.** Build the working table from the skill defaults, and on a re-run keep any role you changed by family, list, or alias (`inherit-parent`, `auto`). `unlimited`, `large`, `medium`, and `small` set the effort token of every real slug, panel entries included, to `max`, `xhigh`, `high`, or `medium`. The effort token is the last token, or the one before a trailing `fast`, on the ladder `max` > `xhigh` > `high` > `medium` > `low`. If the result is not a detected slug, use the same family's detected slug with the highest effort at or below the target, else mark the role as needing a choice. `inherit-parent` and `auto` do not change. So `unlimited` turns `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` into `claude-opus-5-5-max`. Grok slugs top out at `xhigh`, so under `unlimited` the fallback puts Grok at `xhigh` and keeps `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` as it is. `large` keeps both defaults. `small` turns them into `claude-opus-5-5-medium` and `grok-4.7-medium-fast`.

**(c) Show the roles and confirm.** Show every role with its model, marking any real slug not in the detected set as needing a choice. Also list each line step 2 dropped. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto` (both mean: this role runs on the parent chat model) as the options. For panel roles (arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose model family differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Validate

Every real slug written must be in the detected set. `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen real slug is not available, stop and ask again.

### 5. Write the config file

Create `~/.claude/` if needed. Write `~/.claude/pstack-models.mdc` with a `# budget` line with the chosen label and its target effort, and one line per role, using the same labels poteto-mode uses. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent. Shape:

```
# pstack model configuration. One line per role. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default.
# `inherit-parent` or `auto` as a value: the role runs on the parent chat model (omit subagent `model`). Alias entries in a panel list still count toward its fan-out.
# budget: large (xhigh)

```

### 6. Confirm

Tell the user the file was written and that new sessions should pick it up. Re-running this skill updates it. Optional: set `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` for a global subagent default (see Claude Code subagent docs).

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-verification-skill` (resolves wherever pstack is installed: workspace, user, or plugin). On no, move on without pushing.
